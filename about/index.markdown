I'm a software engineer currently working for [KEDACOM][link1], mainly to do back-end development of video surveillance products. I graduated from Jiangsu University with a masterâ€™s degree in Computer Application in 2013.

I love reading, thinking, programming, cooking, like to do something funny/geek/stuff at leisure. I appreciate open source culture, unix development philosophy, and familiar with programming in the Linux Environment, making good utilization of Linux tool chain.

Now I mainly focus on server-side development, give attention to audio/video communication, building high-performance server. In addition,  Studying distributed system is my another favourite. I hope to become an expert in this field.

I'm now living in Shanghai,China. You can find me in these places:
